Window Watch — buzz your phone when it's time to open or close the windows.

Core logic: is it hotter inside than outside?
- outdoor > indoor_est + HYSTERESIS  -> "close"  (outside adding heat, shut up)
- outdoor < indoor_est - HYSTERESIS  -> "open"   (outside cooler, flush the heat out)
- in between                         -> hold the previous state

indoor_est is computed each run using a first-order thermal lag model fed by today's
forecast. THERMAL_ALPHA controls heat bleed-in per hour; SOLAR_GAIN adds daytime load
for south-facing rooms. When a Shelly (or other indoor sensor) is wired up, replace
estimate_indoor() with a real reading — the rest of the logic is identical.

Sends an ntfy.sh push only when the state *changes*.
At 8:10am BST (DAILY_SUMMARY=true) sends a morning forecast brief.
Updates a public Gist with current status for the dashboard/widget.

Config via environment variables:
  LAT, LON          location (defaults to Bow, E3)
  WEATHER_MODEL     Open-Meteo model, default icon_d2 (2km resolution)
  CLOSE_ABOVE       °C used for forecast close-hour prediction, default 25
  THERMAL_ALPHA     heat conductance per hour [0–1], default 0.18
  INDOOR_BASE       overnight cool-down target °C, default 19
  SOLAR_GAIN        daytime solar load added for south-facing rooms, default 3
  HYSTERESIS        dead band °C to prevent flapping, default 1.5
  NTFY_TOPIC        your private ntfy topic (REQUIRED)
  NTFY_SERVER       default https://ntfy.sh
  GITHUB_TOKEN      if set, updates the dashboard Gist
  DAILY_SUMMARY     if "true", sends morning forecast instead of state-change check
  STATE_FILE        path to persist last state, default ./state.json
